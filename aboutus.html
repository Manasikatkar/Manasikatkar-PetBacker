    <h1>Our magnificent partner in crime, the domestic dog, has been living and bonding with human beings for 12,000 years or more. 
        Although they work beside, and for us as well, their value to us as enriching companions has allowed them to flourish, 
        and caused modern humans to devote extraordinary resources to their well-being. The most intelligent dogs are reportedly the border 
        collie and the poodle, while the least intelligent dogs are the afghan hound and the basenji.
